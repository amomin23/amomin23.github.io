            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Hello I am a SPR Auditor with 2 years of experience in Auditing. 
             I love learning about new things and gaining new skills in my aresenal.
             
             I graduated from the University of Houston with a degree in Management Information Systems.
             Over the past 5 years, I have worked as a Business Analyst where I specialized in the financial analytics aspect.
             In addition, I have worked as a Data Analysis and Planning administrator working with different datasets. 
             Currently, I work as a Supply Payment Review Auditor. My various experiences have enabled me to become great at learning new things and being a fast learner.

             I just earned my AI/ML Certificate through University of Texas at Austin and am looking for an opportunity to apply the skills I have gained in a tech related analyst role.
